Why can you only use certain pins for analogWrite()?
AnalogWrite() pins will generate a steady square wave of the specified duty cycle until the next call to analogWrite() 
(or a call to digitalRead() or digitalWrite() on the same pin).The analogWrite function has nothing to do with the
analog pins or the analogRead function. Only certain pins will allow the input of various ranges of data.

What is the range the map() function maps the value to? Why this range?

Re-maps a number from one range to another. That is, a value of fromLow would get mapped to toLow, a value of fromHigh to toHigh, 
values in-between to values in-between, etc. Does not constrain values to within the range, because out-of-range values are sometimes 
intended and useful. The constrain() function may be used either before or after this function, if limits to the ranges are desired.Note
that the "lower bounds" of either range may be larger or smaller than the "upper bounds" so the map() function may be used to reverse a 
range of numbers. The function also handles negative numbers well.
